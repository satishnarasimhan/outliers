# Outliers
==================
Futures & Options (F&O) data can be analysed to pick up activities outside the normal trend, high volume buying / selling, uncharacteristic trades.
These in turn usually indicate either heightened activity by large players or changes in trend. Catching these could lead to potential large winners or high payout events.

These scripts delve into the F&O data to process the information and flag the outliers. The main focus is in on ITM selling amongst market participants.

It is to be noted that not all flagged items will lead to potential winners. They need to be viewed from a perspective of hedged positions and relative size (with reference to the recent past)

Again, these flagged items need to be considered from a breakout / breakdown perspective in terms of price action rather than a standalone basis.

When an outlier is viewed in the context of a breakout / breakout in price action, one can particpate using spread positions. Demand - Supply dynamics usually play out over several days. The target price is the strike price with the highest volume.
